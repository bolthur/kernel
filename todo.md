* [ ] Replace magic values at serial init by defines
* [ ] FPU
  * [ ] Add push and pop of fpu registers within ivt stubs
  * [ ] Extend cpu structure if fpu is enabled
  * [ ] Extend undefined exception to check for fpu error with clear of flag
* [ ] Memory management
  * [ ] Consider and enable CPU related caches for performance

  * [ ] Determine current running core within exceptions
  * [ ] Extend irq check to check corresponding cpu interrupt registers
* [ ] Support further platforms
  * [ ] Add rpi zero support ( armv6 32 bit only with one cpu )
  * [ ] Add rpi 3 support ( armv8 64 bit with smp )
  * [ ] Add rpi 3 support ( armv8 32 bit with smp )
* [ ] Documentation ( man pages or markdown )

# Different projects, not kernel related things to be done
