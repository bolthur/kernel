Version 2.3 (30th November, 2019)
---------------------------------

Converted all text files to reStructuredText (ReST) format.  This format
is still quite readable as raw text, and is much more capable than the
myriad all-slightly-incompatible variants of Markdown.

Updated instructions on how to install the fonts on all Linux consoles.
Updated the console-fonts-utils submodule to the latest version.


Version 2.2 (13th May, 2017)
----------------------------

Updated the console-fonts-utils submodule to the latest version.


Version 2.1 (9th May, 2017)
---------------------------

Moved the utility programs to their own repository on The ZAP Group web
server at `<git://git.zap.org.au/data/git/console-fonts-utils.git>`_.
Added one more program, ``psftx-screenshot``, that generates simulated
screenshots of a font in use.

Changed the definition of font constants ``MIN_WIDTH``, ``MAX_WIDTH``,
``MIN_HEIGHT`` and ``MAX_HEIGHT`` to reflect what ``setfont``\(1) allows
(from 1×1 to 32×32 pixel fonts, not 4×4 to 32×64).  Added some additional
strings to ``psftx-sampler``.


Version 2.0 (29th April, 2017)
------------------------------

Added six new extended fonts, each with 512 glyphs and covering 17 extra
single-byte encodings.  These new fonts were designed to cover every
current European language including those based on the Cyrillic and Greek
alphabets.  Updated the `README` documentation to suit.

Tweaked numerous glyphs in the existing fonts and rearranged the order of
some of their glyphs to match the first 256 glyphs in the extended fonts.

Added a new utility program, ``psftx-sampler``, to generate UTF-8 strings
to the standard output.  Modified ``psftx-encodings`` to include the
Linux kernel VT100 Unicode map.  Also updated the Makefile to generate
and check the file `sha1sum`, to allow versioning of released font files.


Version 1.2 (20th April, 2017)
------------------------------

Added two new fonts, **zap-light20** and **zap-light24**.  These fonts
can be displayed on framebuffer-style consoles only; traditional VGA
consoles can only display fonts that are eight pixels wide.  Also tweaked
the glyph for U+00FE LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN in **zap-light16** and
**zap-light18**, and added mappings for four additional box drawing
characters (LIGHT ARC variants) to all fonts.


Version 1.1 (17th April, 2017)
------------------------------

Added two new fonts: **zap-vga09** and **zap-light18**.


Version 1.0 (15th April, 2017)
------------------------------

Released the first public version of the Linux Console Fonts package with
two fonts: **zap-vga16** and **zap-light16**.


Early history
-------------

A number of console fonts were designed by John Zaitseff between 2004 and
2006, but were never released for general use.  Only one of these fonts,
**zapdef-16**, was widely used on computers maintained by The ZAP Group.
This particular font was used as an inspiration for **zap-vga16**;
however, the glyph repertoire and Unicode mappings of the font were quite
different from the current set.
